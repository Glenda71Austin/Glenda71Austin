## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a full-stack developer with a strong passion for building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that are fast, reliable, and accessible across all devices. My focus is on creating seamless user experiences by combining modern web technologies with best practices in performance optimization.

PWAs bridge the gap between web and native apps, and I love the challenge of delivering that native-like feel using the web stack. Whether itâ€™s implementing service workers for offline access, optimizing load times with lazy loading and code splitting, or enabling push notifications and background sync, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to push the capabilities of what the modern web can do.

On the front end, I enjoy working with frameworks like React or Vue to craft responsive, component-based interfaces. On the backend, I build APIs and services that support these applicationsâ€”ensuring everything runs smoothly and scales efficiently. I also pay close attention to performance metrics, accessibility, and mobile-first design to ensure every app I build works well for all users, regardless of device or connection speed.

This repository features projects, templates, and tools Iâ€™ve created or contributed to as part of my journey with PWAs. You'll find practical implementations of core PWA features, performance audits, and deployment workflows using tools like Lighthouse, Workbox, and modern build systems.

I'm always excited to learn, share, and collaborate with others who are passionate about building better web experiences. If you're interested in PWAs, performance tuning, or full-stack development in general, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out. Letâ€™s keep pushing the web forwardâ€”one progressive app at a time.
